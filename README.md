Suspicious Detection Powered by Artificial Intelligence
Project Description
This project aims to address the issue of delayed response times in crime reporting. The core idea is to develop an application that leverages artificial intelligence to provide instant crime detection and notification to the nearest police station.    

Motivation
Current technology often results in delays in police response due to the time it takes to gather and relay information about a crime.  This application is designed to overcome this limitation by providing immediate alerts to law enforcement.    

Key Features
Instant Crime Detection: The application uses AI to analyze images and detect suspicious activities or crimes.
Automated Notification: Upon detection of a crime, the app automatically sends a notification to the nearest police station.    
Image Capture: The application allows users to upload images. 1 Users can take a picture. 1

Technologies Used
MIT App Inventor: Used for the development of the mobile application.    
IBM Cloud Visual Recognition: IBM cloud’s visual recognition service is used to train and test the model to recognize the crimes.    
Advantages and Scope
Enhanced Security: The application contributes to increased security and a decrease in crime rates.    
Faster Response Times: Enables police stations to respond instantly to criminal activities.
